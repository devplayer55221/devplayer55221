## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- I am Mukund. Most of my experience is in pentesting(Web, API). I also have some experience in thick client pentesting, source code review and server config review. I am trying to be better at source code review. I want to also learn reverse engineering and mobile pentesting properly.
- I would like to collaborate on contributing to cybersecurity open source projects. I would like to improve in CTFs and get started with bug hunting.
- I have mostly coded in Python and Javascript and I would like to code more in Bash, Go, C/C++, C# and Java.
